## Introduction 
This project entailed the analysis and optimization of a database that combined product sales and website traffic data for a sales company using SQL. The database encompassed approximately 2 million records, comprising information gathered from product sales and website usage. The primary objective of this project was to extract valuable insights related to website performance, product analysis, traffic sources, and user behavior.

## Tools and Technologies Used
1) MySQL Workbench
2) SQL
3) SQL Joins
4) SQL Aggregate Functions
5) Database Views

## [Website Performance](https://github.com/vishnukarthik9928/MySQL_Business_Data_Optimization_Project/blob/main/final_project.sql) 

The objective is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the web pages that attract the highest user engagement, enabling us to strategically enhance our business. This analysis serves various use cases, including identifying the most frequently viewed pages by our customers, pinpointing the primary entry points to our website (the first impressions for users), and evaluating how these pages contribute to meeting our business objectives.

## [Product Analysis](https://github.com/vishnukarthik9928/MySQL_Business_Data_Optimization_Project/blob/main/final_project.sql)

The objective of the Product Sales Analysis is to delve into the specific contributions of each product to our business and gauge how the introduction of new products impacts our overall product portfolio. This analysis encompasses several key use cases, including the evaluation of sales and revenue generated by individual products, the monitoring of the influence of new product additions to our existing portfolio, and the observation of product sales trends to gain insights into the overall health and performance of our business. In broader terms, we will assess total sales and total revenue, compute net profit by subtracting total costs, and determine the sales margin as a percentage of profit relative to revenue. This involves summing up the revenue generated by all products and analyzing the margin by considering the difference between product prices and the cost of goods sold (COGS) for each product.

## [Traffic Sources](https://github.com/vishnukarthik9928/MySQL_Business_Data_Optimization_Project/blob/main/final_project.sql)

I actively delve into searching the data, allowing us to identify and allocate investments toward campaigns with the most robust conversion rates (CVR). This approach is further strengthened by the analysis of user behavior patterns across various traffic sources. By comparing and contrasting these patterns, we derive valuable insights that inform our creative strategies, ensuring they resonate effectively with our target audience. Furthermore, we personally identify opportunities for budget optimization by curbing wasteful spending and strategically amplifying high-conversion traffic sources, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and impact of our campaigns
